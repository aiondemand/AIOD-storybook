## Required
- [Node.js] (v10.16.3 or greater). https://nodejs.org/en/download/  (test with node version v12.18.3 and v15.8.0)

1.	` npm install`  installs packages listed in the package.json. Packages are installed in the node_modules folder. 
2.	To start project run ` gulp ` task runs local BrowserSync server and watch for file changes.

4.	Run `gulp final`. Recreate all of your complied files minified.

- `node_modules` Installed Front-end dependencies.
- `/` Folder contains all of your core files. 
- `assets/` Sass files, JS files, images, videos and fonts.
